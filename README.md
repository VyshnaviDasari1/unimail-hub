# UniMail Hub

UniMail Hub is a Spring Boot backend project that I’m building to learn how real backend applications work in the industry.

The idea is to simulate a simple university-style mail and notification system while understanding clean code, REST APIs, and proper project structure.

This project is part of my academic work and will be used for demo and explanation purposes.

## What is done so far
- User registration API
- User login API
- Input validation
- Global exception handling
- H2 in-memory database setup
- Basic login and register HTML pages

## Tech stack
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 Database
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git & GitHub

# Project structure (simple explanation)
- Controller: handles API requests
- Service: contains business logic
- Repository: talks to the database
- Entity: database tables
- DTO: request and response objects
- Exception Handler: handles errors globally

## Sprint progress
Sprint 1  
- Day 1: Spring Boot setup and user registration  
- Day 2: Login API, validation, exception handling, H2 database  

## How to run
1. Clone the project
2. Open it in Spring Tool Suite or IntelliJ
3. Run the main application
4. APIs will run on `http://localhost:8080`

## Note
This project is built step by step to understand how real projects are developed and how to explain backend flow during a demo.
